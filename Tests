Task 2:
Test1: Working Extensible Hash Index
Ouput: Task2Test1.txt
This is the output of creating an extensible Hash Index and inserting data into it. The index class prints to std out
when buckets are being split or when the global depth is being increased. The index also prints how how many free slots
are in a bucket before trying to split it. This is 0 every time. For this test, the max amount of records  allowed in
a bucket was 20. The index was tested on by indexing the students table in the CreateStudentDB java file in
studentClient/simpledb/ of the project folder.
The main methodology for how the extensible hash index is structured can be found in the main writeup.
